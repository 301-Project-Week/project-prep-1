## Cooperation Plan

Strengths:

Sharmarke: Backend code Robert: Public speaking, organization workflow Ryan: CSS 

We can best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project by creating a webpage and pairing tasks within out group for it to be completed and present it.

Professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength:

Sharmarke: Agile to gain more passion Robert: Quality  Ryan: Craft

We plan to approach the day-to-day work by commincating what we want to accomplish.

## Conflict Plan

Our group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises will be to commincate with one another to solve conflicts and worse case scenario pull a ta ticket for technical reasons.

If one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute, we have a meeting about it and have a conversation on that conflict.

Seeing each others commits to see and have morning meeting do discuss problems and work together if the problem arise is how we would approach those concerns.

We will raise those concerns through slack or our morning meetings is how we would raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing.

Having a 3 strike rule, then have a conversation with Jacob about it once it reaches the 3rd strike.

## Communication Plan

From 9 am - 6 pm and possibly after hours.

The platform we will be using is Slack.

One break every hour.

Working after hours if we fall behind.

We will be communicating after hours and on the weekend through Slack.

The strategy to ensure that everyone’s voice is heard is by having honest feedback on how everyone is doing.

We will ensure that we are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up by being empathetic on each other and also make sure we are all on the same page.

## Work Plan

Communicate in Remo on what task we split into doing and have a discussion where we are, when we are stuck, and when we are complete.

Github will be used is the project management tool.

## Git Process

HTML, CSS, JS, and REACT will the be components on Github.

We are all collaborators so we will have copies of the repos.

The Git flow will be main and put everything on the staging branch with a new name for both the front and back end and then each day have one branch per person merge our work by person.

Have all group members review the PRs. Won't merge our own code. At the end of the day we will merge. Commnicate in remo when it is time to merge.

## Ideas

Traveling: Searching for flights for cities/countries. The problem or pain point this solves is showing over 500 airlines so the client can find the cheapest flights for a given itinerary cities. You can also do multi-city searches. MVP: Searching for flights and it is displayed, also being able to login.

Hotel Search: Searching for hotels worldwide. The problem or pain point this solves is that the client is able to find the best deals at over 150,000 hotels worldwide. This will also provide a list of the cheapest hotels in a given location. Once the client selects the hotel that best suits them, they will also to search available rooms and the prices for those rooms. MVP: Search for a hotel and login.
